# hcat

pager implemented in Haskell as part of my learning practice building realworld
applications in Haskell.

I implemented it under the guidance of the book "Effective Haskell Solving
Real-World Problems".

## usage

clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LitFill/hcat.git
```

and use cabal to build then run the executable:

```sh
cd hcat
cabal run hcat -- input.txt
```
